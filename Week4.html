                        <p>Week 4 was a week where we did not do anything special. We started the day with the usual greeting and briefing on what we will be doing throughout the day. For this week we will be focusing on how to improve with the current products we have on hand while consulting with Mr Alwyn.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Lesson Week 4 - The BYTE</h2>
                        <p>The class started as we are introduced to The BYTE. The BYTE is the name of the hackaton we are participating during week 5 and this week we are briefed on it again with more details on where we are allocated for the 3 days the hackaton is held. For my class, all 3 days are held in school where we will be having our pitch and presentation on the third day. While other more fortunate students gets to go to specific campus such as OCBC Campus and Workato Singapore.
                            The other things we are briefed on are the time span for our work and other things we are expecting to follow during the hackaton.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Consultation</h2>
                        <p>
                            For the consultation, we did a teams call with Mr Alwyn to present our prototype and what we have currently done for our main product. 
                            We first showed Mr Alwyn the prototype we have and show him the detailed things we did and how we are going to implement each product and ask for his advice on how each function is going to be layed out.
                            We inquired on what we can do to improve on our current features and make it more user friendly. We proceeded to show him our designed prototype where my team worked on and Mr Alwyn seems impress with our work,
                            He made on comment on our setting page as there are some functions where we do not really need which can help save time to work on ohter features.
                            After learning on of the flaws we have and suggestions he gave, we noted that down and concluded our meeting.
