                        <h2 class="section-heading">Final Touch Ups</h2>
                        <p>This week is the final week where we are able to work and touch up on all the work we have. It is our final change to consult our teacher and make sure that all our work is completed and refined.</p>
                        <p>
                            As the day begins, we all met up in class as usual but this time with statified look at our faces. With looks that we are on track and is ready to show our proud work to our teacher for further feedback.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As Ms Lee entered the class we greeted her and since this is the last week where we are able to consult our teacher, there is nothing else but to show her what we have done along the week.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class = "section-heading">Final Consult</h2>
                        <p>As Ms Lee finished with the usual greeting, she proceeded to go around class to inquire about our progress and what we can show her for the final feedback. As she make her way towards our group, we were prepared to show her what we have.</p>
                        <p>The first work we showed her is our app where we are able to Simplify and translate our text, her comments were that it is a promising feature, however, there might have some flaws that we need to look our for, example the content we are simplifying, we need to make sure there is a filter were we are able to generate it using safe words.
                            Other than that, there have been no further comment on it.
                        </p>
                        <p>The second feature that we have show to our teacher is the theme and font customisation where ching created. This allows the app to match the font size and theme of the phone default settings, this is so that we are able to customise the theme to match the phone's. There isn't any comments for this as it was a job well done.</p>
                        <p>Next we showed her of the product where we are able to adjust how simplified the text generated by our API is, whether it is very simplified in point forms or instead of simplifying, we are able to have a more detailed explanation on the text we are showing. For this there is no comment from the teacher, however, I pointed out to our team that there is a part where the visibility of the simplified text could be made and after adding boxed around it,it looks a lot better.
                        </p>
                        <p>The last thing we showed Ms Lee is the landing page where we have our tutorials and a location to get our app. She have no comments for our initial work but we have asked what else we could add and after hearing on the suggestions, me and Darance started to work on it.</p>
                        <img style = "width:1000px; margin:0 auto;" src = "Pictures/Landingpage.png">
                        <h2 class = "section-heading">Group Discussion</h2>
                        <p>After consulting with Ms Lee, we came together and revised on all the work we need to do. Since our teacher made such good and precised remarks on what we need to do, there is not much discussion and we simply went to work.</p>
                        <p>3 Days before D-Day, we created our powerpoint slides and included all the statistics and work we have gathered and add them into the power point slides. We have also spent a few days to rehearse with each other to ensure that we are not using our phone and is able to give a good presentation which would be good and appealing enough to score an A.</p>
                        <h2 class = "section-heading">Summary</h2>
                        <p>In Summary, what we did this week is that we have consulted with our teacher on what we did and can be improved on. Since we already have pretty much everything done and perfected, we are well prepared for the upcoming presentation and is able to create and perfect our slides before the presentation.</p>
