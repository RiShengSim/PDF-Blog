                        <h2 class="section-heading">Lesson Week 2 - Start of class</h2>
                        <p>When the class starts, Ms Lee, our lecturer, started off the day with a quick summary on last week's lesson to refresh us on what happened last week and gave us a briefing on the things different roles each member will have when working on the hackaton and during the presentation to show off our project.</p>
                        <p>We were given a quick brief on what we will be expecting through out the day and we were introduced to inception deck.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Lesson Week 2 - Things we are taught</h2>
                        <p>What is inception dek?</p>
                        <p>Inception deck is Agile inception deck is important as it helps teams to be able to begin working at the same age. This allows the team to have a clear snapshot of what everyone agreed on and everything discussed, used will be clearly shown upon completetion.</p>
                        <p>Make sure to have a first statement. A first is important as it allows the team to have a way to start discussion and it is normally explain the foundation of the topic we are discussing.</p>
                        <p>What is RCS?</p>
                        <p>RCS, Rich Communication Services messaging, helps teach us on the various way to structure pitchs to help improve on interviews (Important) which can help make a good impression with the interviewer. (RCS can be used with excel)</p>
                        <p>Things to note</p>
                        <p>Make sure to show the solutions you used to solve the problems. Show the technicality of the solution, how and why you use it. What did you use, did you use any external api, what kind of coding langauages did you use, what kind of back-end coding did you use.</p>
                        <p>Make a engaging presenattion. To know if your presentation is engaging, record yourself interviewing and if you are engaged, you did a good job. If not REDO.</p>
                        <p>Make sure you have a good schedule arranged with your group. Ensure there is enough time for everyone including extra time incase they take longer than expected.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Group Discussion</h2>
                        <p>This week's group discussion, we worked on our Inception deck where we plan and find ideas on what we can implement into our project assignment. The first issue we faced while doing the inception deck is the Not List. Since it was our first time doing the not list, we are not sure on how to do it so we decided on using miro userstory board to write down idea and section them out. </p>
                        <p>There were some small obstacles we faced but the next big problem we faced is the team roles. The reason we have a hard time deciding was due to no one really wants to take the UI Designer as we are all not confident in our creativity skills. In the end we all agreed that the roles does not really matter as we would still help each other on their part too. </p>
                        <p>After all the small issues, we proceed to discuss on other stuff we would like to add/remove and things we researched on before the meeting and that concludes the meeting this week.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Summary</h2>
                        <p>This week we have learnt on new things such as the Agile inception deck and how it helps to manage the team's idea and RCS to help us structure and improve pitches to help improve our chances when faced with interviewers.</p>
