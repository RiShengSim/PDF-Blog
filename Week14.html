                        <p>Since this week is white-space week, we do not have any class so there is nothing to talk about in class.</p>

                        <p>
                            For this week, after getting the feedback from our teacher on the things we suggested could be an improvement, we have ruled out the user feature as we ultimately decided it is redundant.
                            We have decided that the features that we are going to decided to use are, customisable themes and making a landing page. But before we implement any of the new features, we have also decided that we are going to make a survey to ask people who have already used our app to comment on what they think is good and useless, how we are able to improve on our work and what they think is a good feature to implement for the future.
                           </p>

                           <p> 
                            We went into a call together to create a survey in order to ensure that all the questions are relevant and try not to make the survey to lenghty as if it is too lengthy the users might not want to complete it and stop half way into the survey.
                            We have included links to vides on both old and new features we are going to make and ask if they are relevant or not or if they think they will be using it. After completing the survey, we send it out to many friends and people who we have asked to help 
                            test our app to try to give us insight on their experience in using the app.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Since this week we have other projects on hand other than PFD, we decided to take this time to collect more surveys data and make sure to give the people time to look at each question. Other than that, we simply did not do much this week and spend more time on other projects that are due soon.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Summary</h2>
                        <p>
                            For the summary this week there isn't much as we do not have class due to it being White-Space week. Our team and came together to help spread the data to friends and families of those who have made use of our app to ask for feedback on their experience in using our app.
                            Due to us having other assignments to do, we decided to take this week to focus on other projects and give the people who we sent our survey to some time to do the survey.
