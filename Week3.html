                        <h2 class="section-heading">Lesson Week 3 - Start of class</h2>
                        <p>Week 3 lesson was special as instead of having a face-to-face lesson with out lecuturer, due to her being sick, we had an online class instead. The class started off with the usual routine and we headed straight to the briefing for what is going to happen during the lesson. The lesson briefing was similar to week 2 as we are presenting to our Open Government Products representative again on what ideas we have now just in more details. The main objective of the day is to present our product and ideas we have and at the end of the lesson we will be looking at past A* presentation to give us insight of what to expect.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Lesson Week 3 - Presentation</h2>
                        <p>After being brief on the procedure on how it will be carried out, we started to show Mr Alwyn our product to ask and confirm on stuff we are unsure of and ask his opinion on features we want to use and apply. We are prepared with an inception deck slides that we were tasked to do the week before and presented to him.</p>
                        <p>When we presented our slides to Mr Alwyn, he was impressed on the things we did different compared to others, especially on our NOT list as we did not follow the template and instead we used miro with userstories to help brainstorm ideas and functions we have and categorise them to four different category. Important, Good to have, Not good and Redundant.
                            Mr Alwyn also mentioned that we should not throw away the functions we are not using, but instead combine or try our best to implement all the ideas we have as they are all quite good in his eyes as it's a waste to throw them away. We also asked him a few questions and after that it concludes the interview.
                        </p>
                        <p>After concluding the presentation, the next thing we did was watching past vids of A* student and after our lecturer gave us some tips and tricks to ace our presentation in the future, that is all we did for this week in class.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Group Discussion</h2>
                        <p>This week's group discussion were short and simple as our group have already solidify most of our idea so after some short discussion we carried on with our work.</p>
                        <p>Me being the UI designer, I am resposible for the wireframe and overall design of our products so I started with our wireframe. The first issue I faced was the overall design. Since I am bad at designing and not very creative, I was not statisfied at my inital design of the wireframe and it looks too dull and hard to use. I decided to scrap my entire wireframe and start from scratch using materials I found online and searched for many different app design from online and the app I am currently using on my phone. After doing my research and spent roughly 4 hours on wireframe, I finally read a design which satisfy me and my team.</p>
                        <p>After the Wire Frame design and changing according to my team's thoughts and recommendations, we proceeded to work on a custom made AI to summarize text instead of relying on chatgpt api. However, after testing out the api for the entire day, we decided not to create it by ourselves as it takes too much time and effort and it was simply not viable to make it with the time we have.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Summary</h2>
                        <p>In Summary, this week we did not do much thinking but we did a lot of confirmation and solidifying our ideas and soltuoin. We created a wireframe to show our representative for the next lesson and have successfully completed the hardest part of the project which is starting. Hopefully next week we would have a working app which is another challenge for us as only 2/5 of the team know how to create a mobile app.</p>
