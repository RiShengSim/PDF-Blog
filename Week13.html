                        <p>As the term break ends and school begin to resume, my friends and I have to wake up early and fix back our internal clock to once again wake up daily and have a proper routine.
                            As we gather in class, we are met with our teacher, Ms Lee, after a month of freedom and fun. We were greeted with warm and welcoming hands not knowing the trouble and hell we are about to face.
                            As students in class settle down and prepare to start our class, the sudden still and tranquil placed pressure in our hearts, knowing the inevitable word is about to arrive as our teacher spoke, ASSIGNMENT.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class = "section-heading"> Chapter 2 - The calm before the storm</h2>
                        <p>As the class settles, we are automatically seated in our respective groups as we caught up with each other on what one another did for our break, some of us enjoyed a fun time traveling to switzerland while some just enjoyed the break that was given staying at home finally being able to play their games and watch movies they have been wanting to see.
                            As we are happily chatting away, we are interuppted by our teacher as the class is starting. We are first met with a warm welcome which is followed by a de-brief on what we were going to be doing as usual. As swallowed our breaths and braced ourselves we were still not prepare when our teacher casually and meticulous explain the thing and requirements we need to do for our current assignment.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We were given a simple yet excruciating task to do, a precise yet vague task hoping to open our eye, brodan our horizion in hopes of improving our already "perfect" work before our break, SimplyWords.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As I look at my team and my team looking back at me, thousand of things wee spoken and understood though nothing was spoken as we carefully listening to what the teach have to say. This time, we do not have the luxury of having our partners OGP(Open Government Products) to be working with us, facilitating our prorgess and give constructive feedback to help aid our work.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class = "section-heading"> Chapter 3 - Plan for success</h2>
                        <p>
                            With the briefing being done and dusted, we were given time to discuss with our groupp members to get started on our work and improvements prior to assignment 1. As we gather around and start on our work, no one said a word as if wanting someone to help save us from this hell we just came back to. I being the "most productive one" decided the lead the pack of "helpless childs" and got straight to the point "How are we going to do this?". 
                            Silence. As I look at them and they look at me, Arash being the good teammate he is open up and suggested on thing we could do to improve according to what we have explain at the end of our presentation in assignmenet 1 and his thoughts on what is originally planned as an improvements but after further assessment, deemed as redundant, the user login feature.

                        <p>As Arash continued speaking, the rest of the group begin to break the silence and ideas and comments were brought up and debate begun to happen. Although still far, but I am starting to see the light at the end of this hellish tunnel.</p>
                        <p>To be continued... (Next Week)</p>

                        <h2 class = "section-heading">Summary</h2>
                        <p>This week is the week where we settle down together after a month long break and getting started to work on our next assignment. My team and I are able to settle in well and is able to ideate on our project and how we are going to improve on our work. 
                            Since this is the first week after the break, we do not expect each of us to be as productive as we are still in the planning phases and know that we are going to be slowly but surely overwhelmned by the amount of workload we are going to be given. With that said, after noting down on our ideas and plans for the future, we came up with the first step. Surveying for feedback for our first app.
