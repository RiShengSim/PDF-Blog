                        <p>On the day of the Hackaton, my team and I have prepared ourselves to work hard for the next 9 hours in order to complete our project with the time left.</p>
                        <p>The start of the Hackaton we were briefed on what the procedures are again and where the activites are at in case we need to relax and rest during our breaks. We are also told that there are snacks and drinks provided for us in case we need them with fun games around to play with too.</p>
                        <p>After settling in our respective classes and attendacne taking, there is not really much for us to discuss as each of us already have our respective jobs to do.
                            On this day we started to work on our presentation slides. Darance, Janani and I are working on the slides as we think of the design, slides flow and allocate each of us what we are going to be presenting. Nothing realy happen on day 1 as we were really prepared for it.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Week 5 - Hackaton Day 2</h2>
                        <p>On day 2, unfortunatly I fell sick and have to stay at home to do a hybrid to work with my teammates. I have notified them the day before where I fell sick and they all understood. Regardless, I still communicated with them via online and discussed on how the slides are going to be operated and polish on the slides that we have and that is pretty much what happened.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Week 5 - Hackaton Day 3</h2>
                        <p>
                            On Day 3 the final day, we have finished all our slides, work and preparations for the up coming presentation and have thought of many things the teachers will ask when and we how we will be addressing it.
                            Before the presentation, we rehearsel for a while and the final presentation came. We were the last group as the random number generator did us dirty and the pressure we have been accumulating throughout watching all the presenters piled up. We were nervous but in the end we felt like we did well and gaves high fives to each others to let each other know we did well and its over.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Week 5 - Hackaton Day 3 Prize Giving</h2>
                        <p>After all the presentations, we have a prize giving section where we are given prize in two different ways, the first section is for people who did best for each topic, the second section is a lucky draw where we people who did not get the prizes in the first section can participate.</p>
                        <p>As the prize ceromony commenced, when it is our class subject's turn to receive the prize, we were scared and hopeful that my team won the prize as it also means we get the highest score in class and in the end WE WON.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Summary</h2>
                        <p>In Summary, after all the hardwork we did in the past few weeks have helped us achieved the best in class.</p>
