                        <p>As the school semester starts, we are introduced to our first module PFD. PFD is one of the few modules where I look most forward to as I saw the PFD sponsors which incldues one of the company I want to work for my internship, OCBC.</p>
                        <p>During the first lesson, we are introduced to our class tutor, Ms Lee, I look forward to learning from Ms Lee and she is one of the Senior Manager for ICT with a well known reputation for teaching among friend I know. We also met peoples representing OGP, Open Government Products, which we inquired about many things we are curious about and things they did to solve certain issue they are facing.</p>
                        <p>Listening to all the things they did, methods they use and their levels of consideration where most people do not even consider, I am impressed with things where on the surface it seems that there are simple ways to solve, but in reality there are many hidden problems that the public could not see. This gave me an understanding that all the solution and ways we thought about to solve a task might not be as simple as it seems as there are always things which prevent us from achieving what we want. By applying methods that we learn during this module, we would be able to solves these obstacles.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Lesson Week 1 - Assignment Introduction</h2>
                        <p>After listening and inquiring to people from OGP, we are given a challenge statement where we are required to find different solutions to solve the problem statement and post it as a post in padlet. After posting our solutions, we spent some time to vote on which solutions are the best. To our surprise, the solutions we post in the padlet are turned into our task for our assignment 1. Moreover, the top 5 post's owners are assigned as the group leaders of each team.</p>
                        <p>After forming the teams, we are suppose to get started with brainstorming about the problem statement within the group and what we are going to use for our solutions and how we are going to implement it.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Group discussion</h2>
                        <p>My team for PFD includes me, Arash, Ching Heng, Darance and Janani. We decided to meet on Sat 21st October to discuss on things we could add and things we can ask our teacher during the next lesson so that we can have a head start compared to other groups.</p>
                        <p>Our solution to the problem statement, "Closing the Digital Divide for Common Services", is to create a website where we are able to simply and summarise text and langauage in order for people to understand what it means easily. The reason for this is due to many news, email and things we see online might not be as clear and can easily be misunderstood and misinterpreted. The goal of this website is to help simplify text and sentances, mainly people in the elderlys, to help them further understand what the news and emails they receive are telling them.</p>
                        <p>The first thing we thought of during the group meeting is to use a api from chatgpt to help us with the langauge filtering as it is hard to programme a machine learning algorithm to help filter, simplify and create sentences for people to understand with our given time. So we decided to use chatgpt api to help solve this issue. We are met with our first issue where we need to pay for the usuage of the api and non of us would want to fork out money to for our assignment.</p>
                        <p>The second idea we have is to make an extension for google chrome. How it works is that when they have the extension installed into their web browser, people will be able to use the extension, copy and paste the sentenaces they want to be summarised and use it easily. The problem we faced is that we are not sure if this is a valid solution and would need to confirm with our lecuturer during the next lesson.</p>
                        <p>The final idea we have is to make a survey, post it online to ask for ideas, flaws and solution they have faced and thought of so that we are able to think and implement those solutions into our project. The main reason for this survery is to find out the people's needs and the problem they face in order to make our website useful for public daily use.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Summary</h2>
                        <p>In Summary, this lesson have helped me understand the importance of looking at things in two different directions. The developers point of view and the users. Solution the user thought of might not be as easy to implement as what they think as there are always obstacles there to prevent the developers to do so.</p>
                        <p>I hope during the next lesson, we would be taught on solutions and ways we can use to help us brainstorm new ideas and solutions.</p>
