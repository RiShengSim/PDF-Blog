                        <h2 class="section-heading">Week 17 - Presentation Day</h2>
                        <p>On this day is what my team and I have been preparing for the past few weeks. We have made sure that everything is prepared and is able to be presented to our teacher.
                            Before we leave our house to meet up in school, we made sure that we all are wearing formal wear so that our team have matching outfits for a better presentation.
                        </p>
                        <p>When we reached school, we settled in class and rehearsed one last time before class starts where we have some time to do some final touch ups. When the teacher arrived, we are given 30 minutes to
                            settle down and touch up on our work. After the 30 minute mark, we no longer are able to discuss with our team and need to focus on the group presenting their work.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class = "section-heading">Presentation</h2>
                        <p>After waiting for all the groups to finally be done with their presentation, a sudden strike on the nerves hit me as finally the time has come where we are able to present our work that we have 
                            been working on for the past few weeks is finally going to be shown and presented. We have been working hard all for this moment. We have prepared phones for the judge to try and use our app.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After we are done presenting, we waited for the teachers to judge and give feedback to us, as the silent went on we are suddent struck with this sentence "Well done, at first I was worried about your group, but after seeing your work, I am impressed. This is clearly a work that have been refined over and over again to reach perfection. Well Done!"
                            After hearing this sentence, Smiles were brought to our faces as we were all happy and statisfied with all the comments given by our teachers. After everything is done, we went back to our seat and all fist bumped and said "GOOD JOB TEAM!". After everything we are finally done with this HELL of a project. We have exited the Tunnel of hell where we entered at the start after the break, we all heave a sigh of relieve as the work period ended and as holiday is coming.
                        </p>

                            As the assignment concluded, we were all happy that we did a good job, we gave each other a pat on the shoulder as we overcame another hard and challenging task with one another. Since the assignment is finished, this is the final blog I have for this PFD Assignment. Now the only task left is to enjoy our well deserved holiday!!!!!!!
